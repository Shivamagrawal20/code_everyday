# ðŸ’» Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to **Daily Coding Challenges**! ðŸŒŸ This repository is dedicated to improving problem-solving skills by tackling coding exercises every day. Each day, I solve a new coding problem and post the solution here, using a variety of programming languages and approaches. The goal is to build consistency, sharpen coding abilities, and explore different types of algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Folder Names**: Each folder is named by date (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`) for easy navigation.
- **Language Variety**: Solutions in multiple languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++.
- **ReadMe for Each Challenge**: Each folder includes a brief problem description, example inputs/outputs, and my approach to the solution.
- **Code Quality**: Solutions are optimized and well-documented for clarity.

## ðŸŒ± Goals and Progress

This repository serves as both a coding diary and a space to showcase my learning journey. By solving and sharing solutions consistently, I aim to:
- Strengthen core programming skills.
- Develop a deeper understanding of algorithms.
- Build a portfolio of coding challenges.

Check out the solutions and feel free to contribute suggestions or alternative solutions!
